# CentOS devtools docker image

Using this provides you the possibility to use any tool in the CentOS 'Developer tools' yum-group.
Using a Docker image makes it easy to:

-   reuse the toolset over and over again
-   reuse the toolset on any platform
-   use the tools in an automated way using any integration tool like Jenkins
-   build custom RPM-type artifacts for zero-touch deployments
-   use this docker-image in an automation pipeline
